			<p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
				acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.
				Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching,
				training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place
				under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate
				themselves.[1] Education can take place in formal or informal
				settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way
				one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The
				methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is commonly
				divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten,
				primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or
				apprenticeship A right to education has been recognized by some
				governments, including at the global level: Article 13 of the United
				Nations' 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and
				Cultural Rights recognizes a universal right to education.[2] In
				most regions education is compulsory up to a certain age</p>
